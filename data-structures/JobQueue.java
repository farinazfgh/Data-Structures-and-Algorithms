/**
 * n independent threads to process the given list of
 * m jobs.
 * Threads take jobs in the order they are given in the input.
 * If there is a free thread, it immediately takes the next job from the list.
 * If a thread has started processing a job, it doesn‚Äôt interrupt or stop until it finishes processing the job.
 * If several threads try to take jobs from the list simultaneously, the thread with smaller index takes the job.
 * For each job you know exactly how long will it take any thread to process this job,
 * and this time is the same for all the threads.
 * You need to determine for each job which thread will process it and when will it start processing.
 * The second line contains ùëö integers
 * Ti ‚Äî the times in seconds it takes to process the ith job.
 * The times are given in the same order as they are in the list from which threads take jobs.
 * Threads are indexed starting from 0.
 * Output Format. Output exactly ùëö lines. ùëñ-th line (0-based index is used) should contain two spaceseparated
 * integers ‚Äî the 0-based index of the thread which will process the ùëñ-th job and the time
 * in seconds when it will start processing that job.
